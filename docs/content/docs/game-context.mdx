All KAPLAY games start with the [kaplay() function](/rescript-kaplay/api-reference/Kaplay.Context#kaplay).
This function makes returns a context that has available all methods and functions that you will use to create your game.

The convention is to create a `GameContext` module that contains the context and exports it as `k`.

```ReScript
// GameContext.res
let k = Kaplay.Context.kaplay(~initOptions={})
```
