[Game objects](https://kaplayjs.com/guides/game_objects/) are the basic building blocks of your game. They are the objects that you will be interacting with.
They are composed from [components](./components), so each object can have the functionality it needs.

## Creating a game object

Start out by creating a new type in a module:

```ReScript
// You can use a nested module or a separate file
module Hero = {
  type t
}
```

Next included the [components](./components) via the `include` module syntax.

```ReScript
module Hero = {
  type t

  open Kaplay

  // We want to draw an image on the screen for an object
  include Sprite.Comp({type t = t})
  // We want to change the position of the object
  include Pos.Comp({type t = t})
}
```

Including a composition will add additional functions to our `Hero` module.
These can be getters and setters for the component state or a function create the corresponding [comp]() instance.

Lastly, we need a way to create our game object, so we include a `make` function:

```ReScript
module Hero = {
  type t

  open Kaplay

  include Sprite.Comp({type t = t})
  include Pos.Comp({type t = t})

  let make = (k: Context.t) : t => {
    // `Context.add` takes a list of `comp` and returns a generic object.
    // This is why we annotate the return function with the type `t`.
    k->Context.add([
        k->addSprite("hero", ~options={width: 30., height: 30.}),
        k->addPos(100., 100.),
    ])
  }
}
```

To create a game object we call the make function:

```ReScript
let hero = Hero.make(k)
```

Note that we pass in the Game context to the `make` function.
We could also open the module that has our context and use it as an import.

Because we included `Sprite` and `Pos` composition, we can now access additional functions via `hero->Hero.`.

```ReScript
let pos = hero->getPos
hero->play("walk")
```

<Aside type="caution">
  Note that both the `include XYZComp` and `addXYZ` call in the `make` function
  will be required to make this work at runtime!
</Aside>

## Adding custom state

So far, our type `t` in our Hero module has been abstract.
We could, however, using a record instead to store some state.

```ReScript
module Hero = {
  type t = { name: string }

  external initialState: t => Kaplay.Types.comp = "%identity"

  include Pos.Comp({type t = t})

  let make = (k: Context.t) : t => {
    k->Context.add([
      addPos(k, 4. , 3.),
      initialState(~name="Freddie")
    ])
  }
}
```

The `initialState` function is a special function that is used to create the initial state of the object.

<Aside type="caution">
  As with all component functions, this big pitfall is that you need to make
  sure they are called inside an `add` function. If you do not call
  `initialState`, the `name` field will be undefined.
</Aside>

## Nested game objects

Sometimes you might be tempted to create a game object inside another game object.
For example a health bar inside a player object.

```ReScript
open Kaplay

module Player = {
  type t
  include Pos.Comp({type t = t})

  module HealthBar = {
    type t

    include Sprite.Comp({type t = t})

    let innerMake = (k: Context.t) : t => { ... }
  }

  let make = (k: Context.t) : t => { ... }
}
```

The danger here is that the `innerMake` function will have access to `Pos.Comp` functions, because of the parent module.
`HealthBar.getPos` will be available, but won't exist at runtime.
Thus, it is best to avoid nested game objects.
